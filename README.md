**General Tips for Self-Assessment:**

1. Re-read your report multiple times, ideally with breaks in between.
2. Ensure clarity and avoid jargon unless explained.
3. Use reputable sources and cite them appropriately.
4. Seek peer feedback, as a fresh pair of eyes can spot areas of improvement.
5. Ensure the report has a clear structure: introduction, body (with sub-sections for each technology), and conclusion.

Remember: Meeting the criteria is essential, but also focus on the coherence and quality of your arguments and information presentation. Aim to produce a well-researched and well-written report!
